# Paraiso-Del-Rei-D-Joao-V :hammer: :video_game:

### Context
Game developed while following the "Complete C# Unity Developer" online course. I took the lectures as a basis to create something to my own liking and this was the result.

### Description
Block breaker game :hammer:, in which you must shoot arrows in order to defeat the Almighty King D. Joao V :crown: and his defenders.

The theme is based on a joke from my group of friends, who are actually in the game as D. Joao V's defenders.
